# 1PoC
Poc on multichain, transactions between peers

HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN THE PROTOTYPE

1) RUN INSTALL_ORIGIN_BAT IN BAT_FILES DIRECTORY
   This will download multichain, install it, create the chain, and launch the node

2) Go in amaris internal solution directory go to the first directory and run a powershell within and run `ng serve` inside it

3) Go in server go directory, src and run src.exe 

4) Go in Back directory, compile and run back.go
   Or if already existing execute back.exe
   It will launch the app, you will have to declare your office, and after you will be able to create new addresses (admin menu)
   And you will be able to use different client options. 


To access the web page to see all the transactions go to : http://localhost:4200

Now we have an unique node with an unique address at the begining. You will have to create another address, or add another node to the network to make it possible to transfer asset.

==========================================================

The prototype can now send money from an adress to another (And send the transaction data to a webpage).
Check for its address content
See all of the network addresses
